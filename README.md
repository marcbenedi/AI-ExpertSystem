This project was developed by Hermes Valenciano, Marti Homs and me (Marc Bened√≠) for the Artificial Intelligence course.

This program creates menus convining first plates, second plates and desserts. 
The complexity is to create a menu that respects the restrictions inputted by the user. 

For example:

* Price range
* Sytle: Modern, traditional, ...
* Allow alcoholic drinks
* Do you want a drink per plate or a drink per menu?
* Month of the event
* Number of persons
* Forbidden ingredients

The program will output 3 menus between whithin the price range.
They will have the inputted style, maybe an alcoholic drink if the user allowed them.

The program also takes care of the plates that are done with ingredients which are not available in the month of the event.
It als takes care of the plates that are done with forbidden ingredients. 

Finally, it will discard complex plates if there are not enough people.

Mark: 9/10.
